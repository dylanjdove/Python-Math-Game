# Python-Math-Game
A math game written in python to test how well you can perform math equations

I wrote this as part of a book on learning python, as I wanted a little more practical application beyond just performing code katas.  It allows the user to go through a list of equations and their score goes up if they get an answer correct.  The program creates a userScores.txt file to hold the scores of any users who've used the program.
